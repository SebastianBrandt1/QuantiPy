Orderflow:
    Observation of orderflow can lead to prediction in price => If buying/selling changes over short time period,
    this might indicate a trend change

Technical Indications:
    Price behaves the same at specific zones => supply/demand zones indicate areas where trades can be initiated

Mean reversion:
    Price always reverts to the mean (Kostolany Man-Dog-Analogy) => If price is too far away from its mean, price
    either reverts or goes sideways

Markets are 20% trending and 80% consolidating => Neutral strategies should win at most market conditions

Small markets are less efficient than big markets => Do the same concepts apply independent of market capitalization?
    Small markets don't offer the liquidity needed for big players, which might result in non-arbitraged edges

Risk is overstated:
    To hedge risk, more is paid than the risk is actually worth => Buying risk should result in profit

Risk distribution:
    Current risk is overstated while tail risk is understated => Buying current risk and hedging against tail risk
    should result in profit
